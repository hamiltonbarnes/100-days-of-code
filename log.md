# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 14th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about markdown syntax and how to use it, forked the **100 Days of Code repo** on github to my profile.

**Thoughts:** I am not new to coding or programming but i realized i have never really being good at it either due to my lazy way of coding and my inability to make time to learn how to code properly.Instead i have rather watched people i trained and helped to learning how to program one way or the other get better at it whiles i am still stuck and not improving.I have really struggled with learning,so sometime early this year i made up my mind to get better at programming. I started taking some online courses, listening to podcasts and reading. In addition to that i also started following freecodecamp's curicullum.But then i still haven't committed myself well enough. So today i decide to commit myself to getting better and improving my skills by learning how to code all over again using freecodecamp. Inview of my commiment i decided to learn how to use markdown and so far i have being able to grasp the basics and as you can see for yourself am already using it. I know that i have a long road ahead and it ain't going to be easy, but i believe it would be worth my while.Come tomorrow **_August 15th 2018_**, i would officially begin my **100 days of code challenge**. Stay tuned. 



### Day 1: August 15, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com).

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.[Comment me out or delete me]
