## Log
**Day 0: August 14th, 2018**
**Today's Progress**: Learnt about markdown syntax and how to use it, forked the 100 Days of Code repo on github to my profile.

**Thoughts**: I am not new to coding or programming but i realized i have never really being good at it either due to my lazy way of coding and my inability to make time to learn how to code properly.Instead i have rather watched people i trained and helped to learning how to program one way or the other get better at it whiles i am still stuck and not improving.I have really struggled with learning,so sometime early this year i made up my mind to get better at programming. I started taking some online courses, listening to podcasts and reading. In addition to that i also started following freecodecamp's curriculum.But then i still haven't committed myself well enough. So today i decide to commit myself to getting better and improving my skills by learning how to code all over again using freecodecamp. In view of my commitment i decided to learn how to use markdown and so far i have being able to grasp the basics and as you can see for yourself am already using it. I know that i have a long road ahead and it ain't going to be easy, but i believe it would be worth my while.Come tomorrow August 15th 2018, i would officially begin my 100 days of code challenge. Stay tuned.

**Day 1: August 15,2018 Wednesday**
**Today's Progress**: Today, i continued with the curicullum on FreeCodeCamp and what learnt was related with [Introduction to the Applied Visual Design Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design).

**Thoughts**: Though am not new to coding,I haven't really made much progress, and now i realise the need to learn and learn well.And after today, i feel like am making progress. I look forward to what is to come next.
